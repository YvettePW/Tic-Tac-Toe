# Tic-Tac-Toe
## Tic-Tac-Toe Exercise
<img src="tictactoe.png" width='300'/><br>
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game. Two players compete (player O and player X) to win by creating a line in any direction. This exercise demonstrates my ability to create a game in React. To run this on your machine, download the files, type http-server -c-1 on your terminal, and go to http://localhost:8080.<br>
Roadmap of Future Improvements: Additional functionality that would be helpful to a user for future iterations would be to add a history of winnings to the board so as to see who is better at the game overall: O or X. Another feature would be an option for each player to select a specific background color that further identifies them.
